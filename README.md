# ATM-BANK-PROJECT
I have uploaded the updated file here. So I have compiled everything together and it works. The only thing that doesnt work as of now is the 'Pincode change' option that maam had told us to implement. So if u guys can, try to fix it. If u guys have any other ideas, feel free to inform in the whatsapp group and then u can work on it and then upload the updated file here.

Update:1- So i fixed the pincode changing option and tkinter is also fixed. All thats left now is to fix tiny errors like, "Do you want to continue?",, and then when we press Yes, it still breaks the loop, stuff like that. After that we're done

Update:2- Added a background to the tkinter window. If you're running the code, dont forget to download the atm_img.png file that is uploaded and also dont forget to change the location name of atm_img.png according to your pc
